# SST-Habitat-Compression
This repo contains a short code snippet for extracting daily sea surface temperature maps from an online repository. It then processes the files to produce maps of SST and SST anomaly, and calculates habitat compression measures (proportion of ocean area with SSTa > 1) through time.
